      Fishing is one of my hobbies during the summer months and it is something I grew up enjoying. What I love most about fishing is the silence and the abundance of nature. Out in the boat you're surrounded by the beauty of the wilderness, with water and skies in all directions. Having the sounds of ripples below and birds calling overhead fills your ears with a sense of ease. It allows you to escape all the tall buildings and busy sounds of traffic from the city and indulge yourself in a stress-free environment. In addition, I love the adrenaline rush you get when your reeling in your catch, waiting to see what is one the other end. Fishing is both relaxing and exciting at the same time and I highly recommend you to give it a try.</p>
